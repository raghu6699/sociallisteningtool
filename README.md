# sociallisteningtool
Project scope is to design a social listening tool that can efficiently filter out inputs that include a word but are not using it in the right context and provide user friendly access to searching social media for relevant trend information on key topics.  Goal is to be able to track consumer trends regularly and adapt what we are searching for periodically without a lot of technical knowledge needed.
